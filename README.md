# kaguya-wants-to-download
Sync the 'Kaguya-sama: Love is war' manga to your filesystem.

Run `Main.py` and you will begin to download all chapters available from [guya.cubari.moe](https://guya.cubari.moe/) into a folder called `Synced_Manga`.
This folder will be located in this project. If new chapters become available on the website, then you can just run the `Main.py` script again to download any missing chapters. It does not take into account, if one or more pages are missing from a individual chapter, only whole chapters.

Please support the author of the manga in any way you can!
